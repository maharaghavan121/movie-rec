# Sample MovieLens Slice

This folder contains tiny CSVs that mirror the schema expected in `data_small/`. They are only meant for documentation previews and will not train a meaningful model.

Files:
- `ratings_sample.csv`
- `movies_sample.csv`
- `links_sample.csv`
- `tags_sample.csv`

To run the pipeline for real, download the full MovieLens `ml-latest-small` archive and place its contents in `data_small/`.
